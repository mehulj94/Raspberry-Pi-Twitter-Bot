A living organism feeds upon negative entropy. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness (i.e., a fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. — Erwin Schrödinger

What is true is already so. – Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse. – Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away. – And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with. – Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived. – People can stand what is true, – for they are already enduring it. — Eugene Gendlin

Confine yourself to observing and you always miss the point of your life. The object can be stated this way: Live the best life you can.

Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man. — Frank Herbert

How many examples do we have of these bodies [of the state] set up to eliminate a problem, actually eliminating it, shutting down their operations and going home? — Gregory Sams

A positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort. — H. Albright

Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others. — H. Jackson Brown, Jr.

The most dangerous man, to any government, is the man who is able to think things out for himself without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable, and so, if he is romantic, he tries to change it. And even if he is not romantic personally he is apt to spread discontent among those who are. — H.L. Mencken

Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage. — H.L. Mencken

When you get into a tight place, and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a moment longer, never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. — Harriet Beecher Stowe

I freed thousands of slaves. I could have freed thousands more if they had known they were slaves. — Harriet Tubman

Whether we are destined to be dust or deity will be determined by how well we learn to cope with the challenges of being intelligent. Intelligence is, ultimately, the most destructive force in the universe. It has the capacity, also, to be the most creative. That knife edge we now live on. — Harry Stottle

When even one American – who has done nothing wrong – is forced by fear to shut his mind and close his mouth, then all Americans are in peril. — Harry Truman

Asking a question is embarrassing for a moment, but not asking is embarrassing for a lifetime. — Haruki Murakami

I always wonder why birds choose to stay in the same place when they can fly anywhere on the Earth. Then I ask myself the same question. — Harun Yahya

The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend. — Henri Bergson

A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone. — Henry David Thoreau, in Walden

Vision without execution is just hallucination. — Henry Ford

Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs. — Henry Ford

Why of course the people don’t want war … But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship … Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country. — Hermann Goering, Nazi leader

Remember, when life’s path is steep, to keep your mind even. — Horace (BC 65-8)

If those in charge of our society — politicians, corporate executives, and owners of press and television — can dominate our ideas, they will be secure in their power. They will not need soldiers patrolling the streets. We will control ourselves. — Howard Zinn

One certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression. Patriotism becomes the order of the day, and those who question the war are seen as traitors, to be silenced and imprisoned. — Howard Zinn

Voting is easy and marginally useful, but it is a poor substitute for democracy, which requires direct action by concerned citizens. — Howard Zinn

To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacriﬁce, courage, kindness. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places — and there are so many — where people have behaved magniﬁcently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an inﬁnite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in deﬁance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory. — Howard Zinn

Protest beyond the law is not a departure from democracy; it is absolutely essential to it. — Howard Zinn

Sedentary culture is the goal of civilization. It means the end of its lifespan and brings about its corruption. — Ibn Khaldun (Muqaddimah)

You must learn to be still in the midst of activity and to be vibrantly alive in repose. — Indira Gandhi

My grandfather once told me that there were two kinds of people: those who do the work and those who take the credit. He told me to try to be in the first group; there was much less competition. — Indira Gandhi

If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them. — Isaac Asimov

And above all things, never think that you’re not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning. — Isaac Asimov

Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition. — Isaac Asimov

Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today – but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all. — Isaac Asimov

The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. — Isaac Asimov

There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere. — Isaac Asimov

Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. — Isaac Asimov

A chipped pebble is almost part of the hand it never leaves. A thrown spear declares a sort of independence the moment it is released… The whole trend in technology has been to devise machines that are less and less under direct control and more and more seem to have the beginning of a will of their own. — Isaac Asimov

There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that “my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge. — Isaac Asimov

Instead of being a student of a (given) field, I would like you to be the field. — Jacob Barnett

You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one. — James A. Froude

A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy, or perhaps both. — James Madison

The best way to think about life, intelligence, and the universe is that they are not separate things, but are different aspects of a single phenomenon. To take liberties with a popular ballad, “We are the world, we are the people, and we are the universe.” To state this proposition from the opposite perspective, the universe is coming to life and waking up through the processes of our lives and thoughts, and, very probably, through the lives and thoughts of countless other beings scattered throughout the cosmos. — James N. Gardner

The very best can’t be hired. They must be courted. — Jason Freedman

It is fortunate to be of high birth, but it is no less so to be of such character that people do not care to know whether you are or are not. — Jean de la Bruyère

A man never discloses his own character so clearly as when he describes another’s. — Jean Paul

At times inactivity is preferable to mindless functioning. — Jenny Holzer

If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you. — Jesus

Once you come to know yourselves, you will become known. — Jesus

The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks. — Jesus Christ

Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world. — Jesus Christ

Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. — Jesus Christ (Matthew 10:16)

Anarchy doesn’t mean out of control; it means out of their control. — Jim Dodge

If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary. — Jim Rohn

We hold steady, we join hands with those walking with us on our spiritual paths, learning that the genius of others will also guide us. Others will be there to lift us up. With them, our full genius takes us to the place where we can overcome digressions and transgressions. There is a super genius at work, that of we as people. — Joe Landsberger, Practice of Genius

Fear is the foundation of most governments. — John Adams

Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men. — John F. Kennedy

Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names. — John F. Kennedy

Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth. — John F. Kennedy

Too often we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. — John F. Kennedy

Five hundred years ago a person in error was a person searching for the truth. — John Leinhard

When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down “happy”. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment. I told them they didn’t understand life. — John Lennon

Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. — John Lennon

Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air. — John Quincy Adams

A journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it. — John Steinbeck

Are we being good ancestors? — Jonas Salk

You must give up the life you planned in order to have the life that is waiting for you. — Joseph Campbell

We’re in a free fall into future. We don’t know where we’re going. Things are changing so fast. And always when you’re going through a long tunnel, anxiety comes along. But all you have to do to transform your hell into a paradise is to turn your fall into a voluntary act. It’s a very interesting shift of perspective … Joyfully participate in the sorrows of the world and everything changes. — Joseph Campbell, Sukhavati

In the South we don’t hide our crazy people or keep them locked up in the attic, we bring them right down to the front porch and show them off. — Julia, Designing Women

The Earth is the Cradle of the Mind — but one cannot eternally live in a cradle. — Konstantin Tsiolkovsky

Men are weak now, and yet they transform the Earth’s surface. In millions of years their might will increase to the extent that they will change the surface of the Earth, its oceans, the atmosphere and themselves. They will control the climate and the solar system just as they control the Earth. They will travel beyond the limits of our planetary system; they will reach other Suns and use their fresh energy instead of the energy of their dying luminary. — Konstantin Tsiolkovsky

Man must at all costs overcome the Earth’s gravity and have, in reserve, the space at least of the Solar System. — Konstantin Tsiolkovsky

Society is composed of persons who cannot design, build, repair, or even operate most of the devices upon which their lives depend…In the complexity of this world people are confronted with extraordinary events and functions that are literally unintelligible to them. They are unable to give an adequate explanation of man-made phenomena in their immediate experience. They are unable to form a coherent, rational picture of the whole. … Under the circumstances, all persons do, and indeed must, accept a great number of things on faith…Their way of understanding is basically religious, rather than scientific; only a small portion of one’s everyday experience in the technological society can be made scientific…The plight of members of the technological society can be compared to that of a newborn child. Much of the data that enters its sense does not form coherent wholes. There are many things the child cannot understand or, after it has learned to speak, cannot successfully explain to anyone…Citizens of the modern age in this respect are less fortunate than children. They never escape a fundamental bewilderment in the face of the complex world that their senses report. They are not able to organize all or even very much of this into sensible wholes… — Landon Winner

Without going out of your door, you can know the ways of the world. Without peeping through your window, you can see the Way of Heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. Thus, the Sage knows without traveling, sees without looking, And achieves without struggle. — Lao Tse

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind; Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily; Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness; Sometimes one is up and sometimes down. Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency. — Lao Tzu

At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want. — Lao Tzu

When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete, everybody will respect you. — Lao Tzu

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished. — Lao Tzu

Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love. — Lao Tzu

To lead the people, walk behind them. — Lao Tzu

You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason frankly with your neighbor, lest you incur sin because of him. — Leviticus 19:17

Irony has only emergency use. Carried over time, it is the voice of the trapped who have come to enjoy their cage. — Lewis Hyde

Today we are afraid of simple words like goodness and mercy and kindness. We don’t believe in the good old words because we don’t believe in good old values anymore. And that’s why the world is sick. — Lin Yutang

Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is a nobler art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials. — Lin Yutang

A weak mind is like a microscope, which magnifies trifling things, but cannot receive great ones. — Lord Chesterfield

It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it. — Lou Holtz

Chance favours the prepared mind. — Louis Pasteur

Anything worth doing is worth doing slowly. — Mae West

How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life — Marcus Aurelius

Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones. — Marcus Aurelius

The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane. — Marcus Aurelius

No social problem is as universal as the oppression of the child. — Maria Montessori

We are not held back by the love we didn’t receive in the past, but by the love we’re not extending in the present. — Marianne Williamson

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. — Marianne Williamson

An insect is more complex than a star..and is a far greater challenge to understand. — Martin Rees

Dear Mr. President: The canal system of this country is being threatened by a new form of transportation known as ‘railroads’ … As you may well know, Mr. President, ‘railroad’ carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 miles per hour by ‘engines’ which, in addition to endangering life and limb of passengers, roar and snort their way through the countryside, setting fire to crops, scaring the livestock and frightening women and children. The Almighty certainly never intended that people should travel at such breakneck speed. — Martin Van Buren, Governor of New York, 1830

It is said that an anarchist society is impossible. Artistic activity is the process of realizing the impossible. — Max Blechman

To say that humans are composed of machines is not to say that we are merely machines. Humans are dignified machines. We are (so far) the most extropic, most complex product of billions of years of evolution. — Max More

Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends. — Maya Angelou

Life is pure adventure, and the sooner we realize that, the quicker we will be able to treat life as art. — Maya Angelou

There’s a world of difference between truth and facts. Facts can obscure truth. — Maya Angelou

Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill… I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together… — Meditations: Marcus Aurelius

When all life is seen as divine, everyone grows wings. — Michael Jackson

Human spaceflight is an instrument of soft power – it serves as an example for members of other nations and cultures to follow and emulate. … Human spaceflight is a marker of modernity and first-class status. — MIT Research Group

Every time I go and shave, I assume there’s someone else on the planet shaving. So I say, ‘I’m gonna go shave, too. — Mitch Hedberg

There is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever. — Mohandas Gandhi

Character is victory organized. — Napoleon Bonaparte

The world does not pay men for that which they ‘know’. It pays them for what they do, or induce others to do. — Napoleon Hill

You don’t become completely free by just avoiding being a slave; you also need to avoid becoming a master. — Naseem Nicholas Taleb

Self-esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves. — Nathaniel Branden

Where you stand depends on where you sit. — Nelson Mandela

The heartbreaking thing is that so much is available and people want so little. — Nicole Daedone’s Teacher

If we choose, we can live in a world of comforting illusion. — Noam Chomsky

If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged. — Noam Chomsky

In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued – they may be essential to survival. — Noam Chomsky

The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn’t betray it I’d be ashamed of myself. — Noam Chomsky

There is massive propaganda for everyone to consume. Consumption is good for profits and consumption is good for the political establishment. — Noam Chomsky

To some degree it matters who’s in office, but it matters more how much pressure they’re under from the public. — Noam Chomsky

The public is not to see where power lies, how it shapes policy, and for what ends. Rather, people are to hate and fear one another. — Noam Chomsky

Stability is when the U.K. and U.S. invade a country and impose the regime of their choice. — Noam Chomsky

We can, for example, be fairly confident that either there will be a world without war or there won’t be a world – at least, a world inhabited by creatures other than bacteria and beetles, with some scattering of others. — Noam Chomsky

Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. — Noam Chomsky

The sign of a truly totalitarian culture is that important truths simply lack cognitive meaning and are interpretable only at the level of “Fuck You”, so they can then elicit a perfectly predictable torrent of abuse in response. We’ve long ago reached that level. — Noam Chomsky

Of course it’s extremely easy to say, the heck with it. I’m just going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority and do the best I can within them. Sure, you can do that. But that’s not acting like a decent person. You can walk down the street and be hungry. You see a kid eating an ice cream cone and you notice there’s no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him because you’re bigger and walk away. You can do that. Probably there are people who do. We call them “pathological.” On the other hand, if they do it within existing social structures we call them “normal.” But it’s just as pathological. It’s just the pathology of the general society. — Noam Chomsky

States are violent institutions. The government of any country, including ours, represents some sort of domestic power structure, and it’s usually violent. States are violent to the extent that they’re powerful, that’s roughly accurate. — Noam Chomsky

If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don’t like. Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re in favor of freedom of speech, that means you’re in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise. — Noam Chomsky

Jesus himself, and most of the message of the Gospels, is a message of service to the poor, a critique of the rich and the powerful, and a pacifist doctrine. And it remained that way, that’s what Christianity was up… until Constantine. :Constantine shifted it so the cross, which was the symbol of persecution of somebody working for the poor, was put on the shield of the Roman Empire. It became the symbol for violence and oppression, and that’s pretty much what the church has been until the present. — Noam Chomsky

Education is a system of imposed ignorance. — Noam Chomsky

Social and political issues in general seem to me fairly simple; the effort to obfuscate them in esoteric and generally vacuous theory is one of the contributions of the intelligentsia to enhancing their own power and the power of those they serve. — Noam Chomsky

There are plenty of things that are unknown, but are assumed reasonably to exist, even in the most basic sciences. Maybe 90 percent of the mass-energy in the universe is called “dark,” because nobody knows what it is. — Noam Chomsky

Wisdom lies neither in fixity nor in change, but in the dialectic between the two. — Octavio Paz

Anyone who lives within their means, suffers from a serious lack of imagination. — Oscar Wilde

It is what you read when you don’t have to that determines what you will be when you can’t help it. — Oscar Wilde

Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing. — Oscar Wilde

Creativity is the greatest rebellion in existence. — Osho

That which can be destroyed by the truth should be. — P.C. Hodgell

Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. — Pablo Picasso

We can never judge the lives of others, because each person knows only their own pain and renunciation. It’s one thing to feel that you are on the right path, but it’s another to think that yours is the only path. — Paulo Coelho

The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. — Pearl Buck

Enlightenment is a direct experience with reality. — Pema Chodron

Democracy passes into despotism. — Plato

Democracy… is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder; and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike. — Plato

Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws. — Plato

Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. — Plato

Man is a wingless animal with two feet and flat nails. — Plato

Philosophy is the highest music. — Plato

Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men. — Plato

The community which has neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblest principles. — Plato

The man who makes everything that leads to happiness depends upon himself, and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living happily. This is the man of moderation, the man of manly character and of wisdom. — Plato

The most virtuous are those who content themselves with being virtuous without seeking to appear so. — Plato

There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot. — Plato

We ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like him is to become holy, just, and wise. — Plato

Wisdom alone is the science of other sciences. — Plato

The greatest penalty of evildoing – namely, to grow into the likeness of bad men. — Plato

You are young, my son, and, as the years go by, time will change and even reverse many of your present opinions. Refrain therefore awhile from setting yourself up as a judge of the highest matters. — Plato

Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind’s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. — Plato

When men speak ill of thee, live so as nobody may believe them. — Plato

This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector. — Plato

Seeing the lightest and gayest purple was then most in fashion, he would always wear that which was the nearest black; and he would often go out of doors, after his morning meal, without either shoes or tunic; not that he sought vain-glory from such novelties, but he would accustom himself to be ashamed only of what deserves shame, and to despise all other sorts of disgrace. — Plutarch, on Cato the Younger

One of these centuries, the brutes, private or public, who believe that they can rule their betters by force, will learn the lesson of what happens when brute force encounters mind and force. — Ragnar Danneskjöld

Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today. — `Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.’ — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. — Ralph Waldo Emerson

None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone. — Ralph Waldo Emerson

He then learns that in going down into the secrets of his own mind he has descended into the secrets of all minds. — Ralph Waldo Emerson

People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character. — Ralph Waldo Emerson

Do what you know and perception is converted into character. — Ralph Waldo Emerson

It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after your own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. — Ralph Waldo Emerson

Doubt is the origin of wisdom. — Rene Descartes

The essence of life is statistical improbability on a colossal scale. — Richard Dawkins

Lucky accidents seldom happen to writers who don’t work. You will find that you may rewrite and rewrite a poem and it never seems quite right. Then a much better poem may come rather fast and you wonder why you bothered with all that work on the earlier poem. Actually, the hard work you do on one poem is put in on all poems. The hard work on the first poem is responsible for the sudden ease of the second. If you just sit around waiting for the easy ones, nothing will come. Get to work. — Richard Hugo

A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. — Robert A. Heinlein

I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me. If they hold thought to be dangerous – if they aver that doubt is a crime, then I attack them one and all, because they enslave the minds of men. — Robert Green Ingersoll

The world is tragic to those who feel and comic to those who think. — Robert Walpole

Truth is treason in the empire of lies. — Ron Paul

When someone is counting out gold for you, don’t look at your hands, or the gold. Look at the giver. — Rumi

This readiness to assume the guilt for the threats to our environment is deceptively reassuring: We like to be guilty since, if we are guilty, it all depends on us. We pull the strings of the catastrophe, so we can also save ourselves simply by changing our lives. What is really hard for us (at least in the West) to accept is that we are reduced to the role of a passive observer who sits and watches what our fate will be. To avoid this impotence, we engage in frantic, obsessive activities. We recycle old paper, we buy organic food, we install long-lasting light bulbs—whatever—just so we can be sure that we are doing something.

It took me better than a quarter century to learn, the hard way, that hard work at something you want to be doing is the most fun that you can have out of bed . . . to learn that the smart man finds ways to make everything he does be work; to learn that “leisure” time is truly pleasurable (indeed tolerable) only to the extent that is its subconscious grazing for information with which to infuse newer, better work. — Spider Robinson
